Movie_Bot

As the name suggests, it is a chatbot where in you can ask reviews, details about any movie. Apart from this, the bot has knowledge to respond to common phrases like hey, who are you?, etc in a complete sense. 
This is my first attempt in developing chatbots. 
The bot has been developed on top of technologies:

Flask - A microframework in Python for routing, pythonic logics, api requests, responses, and extracting information

DialogFlow -  A Google-owned developer of humanâ€“computer interaction technologies based on natural language conversations

Pusher - APIs to enable devs building realtime features (making the bot real-time)

OMDB API - API to fetch details about movies

Ngrok - A lightweight tool that creates a secure tunnel on your local machine along with a public URL you can use to browse on local host.

Requirements:

Python 3.6+ (preferably)

Pusher Channels

Javascript (Jquery)

DialogFlow

Ngrok

Also: Some basic HTML, CSS to improve UI.

Hope you like it!
